# Problem 1

### Load and clean NYC transit dataset

``` r
subway_data = 
  read_csv(file = '~/Desktop/Data Science I/Homeworks/dxy2101_hw2_P8105/subway.csv') %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(line:entry, vending, ada) %>%
  mutate(
    entry = recode(entry, "YES" = TRUE, "NO" = FALSE)
    )
```

``` r
# List variables in dataset
names(subway_data)
```

    ##  [1] "line"              "station_name"      "station_latitude" 
    ##  [4] "station_longitude" "route1"            "route2"           
    ##  [7] "route3"            "route4"            "route5"           
    ## [10] "route6"            "route7"            "route8"           
    ## [13] "route9"            "route10"           "route11"          
    ## [16] "entrance_type"     "entry"             "vending"          
    ## [19] "ada"

The NYC transit dataset includes the following variables: line, station
name, station latitude, station longitude, route numbers 1-11, entrance
type, entry, vending, and ADA compliance.

Thus far, data cleaning has comprised of making all of the variable
names the same format, retaining relevant variables, and converting the
`entry` variable into a logical variable for future analysis. There are
1868 rows and 19 columns.

This data is not tidy.

There are 465 distinct stations. There are 84 stations that are ADA
compliant. 0.63 of the station entrances/exits without vending allow
entrance.

``` r
# Convert all route variables to characters
subway_data =
  subway_data %>%
  mutate(
    route8 = as.character(route8),
    route9 = as.character(route9),
    route10 = as.character(route10),
    route11 = as.character(route11)
  )
  
# Make route number and route name distinct variables
subway_data =
  pivot_longer(
    subway_data,
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "number",
    names_prefix = "route",
    values_to = "name"
  )
```

Of the stations that serve the A train, 17 are ADA compliant.
