# Problem 1

### Load, clean, and use NYC transit dataset

``` r
subway_data = 
  read_csv(file = '~/Desktop/Data Science I/Homeworks/dxy2101_hw2_P8105/subway.csv') %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(line:entry, vending, ada) %>%
  mutate(
    entry = recode(entry, "YES" = TRUE, "NO" = FALSE)
    )
```

``` r
# List variables in dataset
names(subway_data)
```

    ##  [1] "line"              "station_name"      "station_latitude" 
    ##  [4] "station_longitude" "route1"            "route2"           
    ##  [7] "route3"            "route4"            "route5"           
    ## [10] "route6"            "route7"            "route8"           
    ## [13] "route9"            "route10"           "route11"          
    ## [16] "entrance_type"     "entry"             "vending"          
    ## [19] "ada"

The NYC transit dataset includes the following variables: line, station
name, station latitude, station longitude, route numbers 1-11, entrance
type, entry, vending, and ADA compliance.

Thus far, data cleaning has comprised of making all of the variable
names the same format, retaining relevant variables, and converting the
`entry` variable into a logical variable for future analysis. There are
1868 rows and 19 columns.

This data is not tidy.

There are 465 distinct stations. There are 84 stations that are ADA
compliant. 0.63 of the station entrances/exits without vending allow
entrance.

``` r
# Convert all route variables to characters
subway_data =
  subway_data %>%
  mutate(
    route8 = as.character(route8),
    route9 = as.character(route9),
    route10 = as.character(route10),
    route11 = as.character(route11)
  )
  
# Make route number and route name distinct variables
subway_data =
  pivot_longer(
    subway_data,
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "number",
    names_prefix = "route",
    values_to = "name"
  )
```

Now, this data is tidy.

Of the stations that serve the A train, 17 are ADA compliant.

# Problem 2

### Load, clean, and use Trash Wheel dataset

``` r
# Read and clean Mr. Trash Wheel dataset
mr_data = 
  read_excel('~/Desktop/Data Science I/Homeworks/dxy2101_hw2_P8105/trash.xlsx', sheet = 1) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(dumpster:homes_powered) %>%
  na.omit(mr_data) %>%
  mutate(
    sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls, 0))
  )
```

``` r
# Read and clean Professor Trash Wheel dataset
prof_data =
  read_excel('~/Desktop/Data Science I/Homeworks/dxy2101_hw2_P8105/trash.xlsx', sheet = 2) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(dumpster:homes_powered) %>%
  na.omit(prof_data) %>%
  mutate(
    sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls, 0)),
    dumpster = as.character(dumpster)
  )
```

``` r
# Add column indicating trash collector
mr_data = 
  data.frame(append(mr_data, c(collector="Mr"), after=1))

prof_data =
  data.frame(append(prof_data, c(collector="Professor"), after=1))

# Join data frames
full_df = 
  full_join(mr_data, prof_data)
```

The `full_df` dataset contains data on the number of dumpsters and types
of trash collected by both Mr. Trash Wheel and Professor Trash Wheel
from 2014 to beginning of 2021. In total, there are 524 observations.
Key variables include: collector, data collected, weight (tons), types
of trash collected and amount collected, and number of homes powered.

The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel was 135.5
tons.

The total number of sports balls collected by Mr. Trash Wheel in 2020
was 856.

# Problem 3

### Load, clean, and use FiveThirtyEight datasets

``` r
# Clean data in pols-month.csv
pols_data = 
  read_csv(file = '~/Desktop/Data Science I/Homeworks/dxy2101_hw2_P8105/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv') %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(mon = as.character(mon)) %>%

                "12" = "dec"))

# Make dataset tidy. Add variable for presidents.
pols_tidy_data = 
  pivot_longer(
    pols_data,
    cols = starts_with("prez"),
    names_to = "president",
    names_prefix = "prez_",
    values_to = "value") %>%
  mutate(
    value = as.numeric(value)
  ) %>%
  select(-value, -day)
```

``` r
# Clean data in snp.csv

# Clean data in unemployment.csv
unem_data = 
  read_csv(file = '~/Desktop/Data Science I/Homeworks/dxy2101_hw2_P8105/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv') %>%
  janitor::clean_names()

# Make dataset tidy
unem_tidy_data =

```

``` r
pols_snp =
  full_join(pols_tidy_data, snp_data)

pols_snp_unemployment = 
  full_join(pols_snp, unem_tidy_data)
```

`pols-month.csv`, `snp.csv`, and `unemployment.csv` were imported,
cleaned and made tidy to create the `pols_snp_unemployment` dataset
containing observations and variables from all three input datasets.
`pols-month.csv`contains information on the political standing of
national politicians at a given time. `snp.csv` contains information on
the S&P market index at a given time. `unemployment.csv` contains
information on the percentage of unemployment at a given time. All input
datasets were cleaned to ensure that the given time points were
organized by year and by month.

The resulting dataset, `pols_snp_unemployment`, contains 1650
observations and 12 variables. The range of years is (1947, 2015). The
key variables included are for a given year and month are the following:
number of Republican governors, number of Democrat governors, number of
Republican senators, number of Democrat senators, number of Republican
representatives, number of Democrat representatives, whether or not the
president at the time was a Republican or Democrat, the S&P index during
the day and closing, and the percentage of people unemployed.
