# Problem 1

### Load and clean NYC transit dataset

``` r
subway_data = 
  read_csv(file = '~/Desktop/Data Science I/Homeworks/dxy2101_hw2_P8105/subway.csv') %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(line:entry, vending, ada) %>%
  mutate(
    entry = recode(entry, "YES" = TRUE, "NO" = FALSE)
    )
```

``` r
# List variables in dataset
names(subway_data)
```

    ##  [1] "line"              "station_name"      "station_latitude" 
    ##  [4] "station_longitude" "route1"            "route2"           
    ##  [7] "route3"            "route4"            "route5"           
    ## [10] "route6"            "route7"            "route8"           
    ## [13] "route9"            "route10"           "route11"          
    ## [16] "entrance_type"     "entry"             "vending"          
    ## [19] "ada"

The NYC transit dataset includes the following variables: line, station
name, station latitude, station longitude, route numbers 1-11, entrance
type, entry, vending, and ADA compliance.

Thus far, data cleaning has comprised of making all of the variable
names the same format, retaining relevant variables, and converting the
`entry` variable into a logical variable for future analysis. There are
1868 rows and 19 columns.

This data is not tidy.

``` r
# Number of stations without vending that do not allow entrance
x = nrow(
  subway_data %>% 
  filter(vending=='NO', entry==FALSE) %>% 
  distinct(station_name, line)
  )

# Number of stations without vending that do allow entrance
y = nrow(
  subway_data %>% 
  filter(vending=='NO', entry==TRUE) %>% 
  distinct(station_name, line)
  )
```

There are 465 distinct stations. There are 84 stations that are ADA
compliant. 0.63 of the station entrances/exits without vending allow
entrance.
